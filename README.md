# KeepItSimple - Keep it Simple Apple!

The Notification Center is a mess as it tries to move notifications around into Older Notifications or some other lists. This simple tweak will force iOS to always maintain a single Notification list.
I made this tweak as the alternatives (OneNotify & Notif) just simulate a swipe up gesture on the notification center & force reveal all the sections. But then you are left with the ugly Notification Center Header text! This tweak eliminates all that overhead & keeps it simple ;)
No options to configure.
